## Main Features
* Component based UI with state management (similar to React.js or Flutter)
* Very fast hot reload even when debugging
* Completely integrated with Visual Studio 2019 (no need to install or lunch external servers) ([download the VS extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adospace.ReactorUI-Xamarin))

## Samples
This repository contains many samples of ReactorUI components: I'm heavily working on them adding new ones every week.

Furthermore I've opened a new repository that shows how to implement a fully working app: please take a look https://github.com/adospace/reactorui-xamarin-realworld

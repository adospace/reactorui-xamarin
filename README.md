## Samples
This repository contains many samples of ReactorUI components: I'm heavily working on them adding new ones every week.

Furthermore I've opened a new repository that shows how to implement a fully working app: please take a look https://github.com/adospace/reactorui-xamarin-realworld


## Video Tutorials
In the following 3 parts video, I'll show how create a sample Calculator app in ReactorUI for Xamarin Forms: You can get a deeper look at how to create statefull components, how react to state changes and modify visual tree accordinly. 

Furthermore you'll learn how create an adaptative layout and react to landscape/poirtrat mode change event.
